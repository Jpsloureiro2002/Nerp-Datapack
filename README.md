# Nerp-Datapack
 A custom Minecraft datapack designed for private SMP servers that introduces new weapons, bosses, and utility items to enhance the gameplay experience. This datapack includes a variety of new weapons and tools, powerful bosses with unique abilities, and a coins system for trading with players. With this datapack, players can enjoy a fresh and exciting new Minecraft experience with their friends on their private server.
 
 # What do you need
  To use the dynamic light feature in this datapack, you'll need to use Dynamic Lights v1.4 with some modifications. However, I don't have permission to share the modified version or publish it publicly. If you're interested, I've included the changes I made at the end of the README file.
  
  In addition, you'll need the texture pack for this datapack to work properly. The texture pack can be found in the release [link](https://github.com/Jpsloureiro2002/Nerp-Datapack/releases/tag/Alpha) . Be sure to download and install it before using the datapack.
